# Raspberry-Pi-High-Altitude-Balloon
## Introduction
This Raspberry Pi High Altitude Balloon will be designed to study PM (particulate matter) fluctuations depending on time and altitude. The goals of the mission are:
1. Succesfully complete the flight and recovery
2. Transmit enviromental data
3. Succesfull recovery of data and video

## Bill of Materials
1. Raspberry Pi Pico with Headers
2. Adafruit RFM95W LoRa Radio Transceiver Breakout (IMPORTANT: Check which frequency is used in your country. In my case (Mexico) 915 MHz is used)
3. 
## Instructions
### Download and Install Arduino IDE
Download the Arduino IDE from [https://www.arduino.cc/en/software]. While installing (and a while after), there will be a lot of warnings, but don't worry, it's just Arduino IDE installing drivers.
