# Raspberry-Pi-High-Altitude-Balloon
## Introduction
This Raspberry Pi High Altitude Balloon will be designed to study PM (particulate matter) fluctuations depending on time and altitude. The goals of the mission are:
1. Succesfully complete the flight and recovery
2. Transmit enviromental data
3. Succesfull recovery of data and video
